Started out as a little D&D utility and then got infused with some grand ideas.


Notes -- make sure to run npm update in webapp to get the angular stuff installed local
create a data/characters directory if you want to store characters it's not part of src and probably should be relocated to a proper doc store.
mvn compile && mvn package - creates a nice fat jar.

plenty of unused libs in their that I intend to use as time goes by.
