Of course, the object or creature must be such as to allow the aerial servant to physically bring it to the cleric or his or her assign. The spell caster should keep in mind the consequences of having an aerial servant prevented, for any reason, from completion of the assigned duty.

The cleric must have a Protection From Evil spell, or be within a magic circle, thaumaturgic triangle, or pentagram when summoning an aerial servant unless the cleric has his or her religious symbol or a religious artifact or relic to use to control the creature. Otherwise, the creature will slay its summoner and return from whence it came.

    "description": "Explanation/Description: This powerful spell enables the cleric casting it to imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. The animated object, or objects, then attack whomever or whatever the cleric first designates. The object can be of any material whatsoever - wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, etc. The speed of movement of the object is dependent upon its means of propulsion and its weight. A large wooden table would be rather heavy, but its legs would give it speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal would rock forward at 1\" per round, a stone statue would move at 4\" per round, a wooden statue 8\" per round, an ivory stool of light weight would move at 12\". Slithering movement is about 1\" to 2\" per round, rolling 3\" to 6\" per round. The damage caused by the attack of an animated object is dependent upon its form and composition. Light, supple objects can only obscure vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip. smother, etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1-2 hit points of damage or possibly obstruct and trip as do light, supple objects. Hard, medium weight objects can crush or strike for 2-8 hit points of damage, those larger and heavier doing 3-12, 4-16, or even 5-20 hit points of damage. The frequency of attack of animated objects is dependent upon their method of locomotion, appendages, and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five melee rounds to as frequently as once per melee round. The armour class of the object animated is basically a function of material and movement ability with regard to hitting. Damage is dependent upon the type of weapon and the object struck. A sharp cutting weapon is effective against fabric, leather, wood and like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your referee will determine all of these factors, as well as how much damage the animated object can sustain before being destroyed. The cleric can animate 1 cubic foot of material for each level of experience he or she has attained. Thus, a 14th level cleric could animate one or more objects whose solid volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet, i.e. a large statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen average crocks.",
    "fullSpellText": "Animate Object (Alteration)\nLevel: 6     Components:\tV, S    Range:\t3\"     Casting Time: 8 segments    Duration:\t1 round/level     Saving Throw: None    Area of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level\nExplanation/Description: This powerful spell enables the cleric casting it to imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. The animated object, or objects, then attack whomever or whatever the cleric first designates. The object can be of any material whatsoever - wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, etc. The speed of movement of the object is dependent upon its means of propulsion and its weight. A large wooden table would be rather heavy, but its legs would give it speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal would rock forward at 1\" per round, a stone statue would move at 4\" per round, a wooden statue 8\" per round, an ivory stool of light weight would move at 12\". Slithering movement is about 1\" to 2\" per round, rolling 3\" to 6\" per round. The damage caused by the attack of an animated object is dependent upon its form and composition. Light, supple objects can only obscure vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip. smother, etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1-2 hit points of damage or possibly obstruct and trip as do light, supple objects. Hard, medium weight objects can crush or strike for 2-8 hit points of damage, those larger and heavier doing 3-12, 4-16, or even 5-20 hit points of damage. The frequency of attack of animated objects is dependent upon their method of locomotion, appendages, and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five melee rounds to as frequently as once per melee round. The armour class of the object animated is basically a function of material and movement ability with regard to hitting. Damage is dependent upon the type of weapon and the object struck. A sharp cutting weapon is effective against fabric, leather, wood and like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your referee will determine all of these factors, as well as how much damage the animated object can sustain before being destroyed. The cleric can animate 1 cubic foot of material for each level of experience he or she has attained. Thus, a 14th level cleric could animate one or more objects whose solid volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet, i.e. a large statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen average crocks."

    "description": "Explanation/Description: By means of the Astral Spell a cleric is able to project his or her astral body into the Astral Plane, leaving his or her physical body and material possessions behind on the Prime Material Plane, (the plane on which the entire universe and all of its parallels have existence). Only certain magic items which have multi-planed existence can be brought into the Astral Plane. As the Astral Plane touches upon all of the first levels of the Outer Planes, the cleric can travel astrally to any of these Outer Planes as he or she wills. The cleric then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a body on the plane of existence he or she has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of the Astral Spell, but a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material Plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures on the Astral Plane. At all times the astral body is connected to the material by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially, but generally only the psychic wind can normally cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed on a different plane. the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body, and the cord simply returns to the latter where it rests on the Prime Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astrally projected persons are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions do not affect creatures not existing on the Astral Plane. The spell lasts until the cleric desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means (Dispel Magic or destruction of the cleric\u0027s body on the Prime Material Plane). The cleric can take up to five other creatures with him or her by means of the Astral Spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the cleric. These fellow travellers are dependent upon the cleric and can be stranded. Travel in the Astral Plane can be slow or fast according to the cleric\u0027s desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the conceptualization of the cleric.

    "description": "Explanation/Description: This spell will affect any single person or mammal it is cast upon. The creature then will regard the druid who cast the spell as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the druid to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the druid will be viewed in its most favourable way. Thus, a charmed creature would not obey a suicide command, but might believe the druid if assured that the only chance to save the druid\u0027s life is if the creature holds back an onrushing red dragon for \"just a round or two\".

The creature then will regard the druid who cast the spell as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the druid to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the druid will be viewed in its most favourable way. Thus, a charmed creature would not obey a suicide command, but might believe the druid if assured that the only chance to save the druid\u0027s life is if the creature holds back an onrushing red dragon for \"just a round or two\".

The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When the Snare spell is cast upon it, the cordlike object blends with the background of its location. One end of the snare is tied in a loop which will contract about 1 or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle (note that the head of a worm or snake could also be thus ensnared). If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare will be fastened to it, and the dweomer of the spell will cause it to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, thus causing 1-6 hit points of damage to the creature trapped, and lifting off the ground by the trapped member(s) (or strangling it if the head/neck triggered the snare). If no such sapling or tree is available, the cord-like object will tighten upon the member(s) and then enwrap the entire creature, doing no damage, but tightly binding it. The snare is magical, so for 1 hour it is breakable only by storm giant or greater strength (23); each hour thereafter, the snare material loses magic so as to become 1 point more breakable per hour - 22 after 2 hours, 21 after 3, 20 after 4 - until 6 full hours have elapsed. At that time, 18 strength will break the bonds. After 12 hours have elapsed, the materials of the snare lose all of the magical properties, and the loop opens, freeing anything it had held.

    "description": "Explanation/Description: By means of a Control Winds spell the druid is able to alter wind force in the area of effect. For every level of his or her experience, the druid is able to increase or decrease wind force by 3 miles per hour. Winds in excess of 30 miles per hour drive small flying creatures (those eagle-sized and under) from the skies and severely inhibit missile discharge. Winds in excess of 45 miles per hour drive even man-sized flying creatures from the skies. Winds in excess of 60 miles per hour drive all flying creatures from the skies and uproot trees of small size, knock down wooden structures, tear off roofs, etc. Winds in excess of 75 miles per hour are of hurricane force and cause devastation to all save the strongest stone constructions. A wind above 30 miles per hour makes sailing difficult, above 45 miles per hour causes minor ship damage, above 60 miles per hour endangers ships, and above 75 miles per hour sinks ships. There is an \"eye\" of 4\" radius around the druid where the wind is calm. A higher level druid can use a Control Winds spell to counter the effects of a like spell cast by a lower level druid (cf. control weather). The spell remains in force for 1 turn for each level of experience of the druid casting it. Once the spell is cast, the wind force increases by 3 miles per hour per round until maximum speed is attained. When the spell is exhausted, the force of the wind diminishes at the same rate. Note that while the spell can be used in underground places, the \"eye\" will shrink in direct proportion to any confinement of the wind effect, i.e. if the area of effect is a 48\" radius, and the confined space allows only a 46\" radius, the \"eye\" will be 2\" radius; and any space under 44\" radius will completely eliminate the \"eye\" and subject the spell caster to the effects of the wind.",

    "description": "Explanation/Description: The druidic Weather Summoning spell is similar to the Control Weather spell (q.v.) of clerical nature. By casting the spell, the druid calls forth weather commensurate with the climate and season of the area he or she is in at the time, Thus, in spring a tornado, thunderstorm, cold, sleet storm, or hot weather could be summoned. In summer a torrential rain, heat wave, hail storm, etc. can be called for. In autumn, hot or cold weather, fog, sleet, etc. could be summoned. Winter allows great cold, blizzard, or thaw conditions to be summoned. Hurricane-force winds can be summoned near coastal regions in the late winter or early spring. The summoned weather is not under the control of the druid. It might last but a single turn in the case of a tornado, or for hours or even days in other cases. The area of effect likewise varies from about 1 square mile to 100 or more square miles. Note that several druids can act in concert to greatly affect weather, controlling winds and/or working jointly to summon very extreme weather conditions.

    "fullSpellText": "Weather Summoning (Conjuration/Summoning)\nLevel: 6     Components:\tV, S, M    Range: 0     Casting Time: 1 turn    Duration:\tSpecial     Saving Throw: None    Area of Effect: Special\nExplanation/Description: The druidic Weather Summoning spell is similar to the Control Weather spell (q.v.) of clerical nature. By casting the spell, the druid calls forth weather commensurate with the climate and season of the area he or she is in at the time, Thus, in spring a tornado, thunderstorm, cold, sleet storm, or hot weather could be summoned. In summer a torrential rain, heat wave, hail storm, etc. can be called for. In autumn, hot or cold weather, fog, sleet, etc. could be summoned. Winter allows great cold, blizzard, or thaw conditions to be summoned. Hurricane-force winds can be summoned near coastal regions in the late winter or early spring. The summoned weather is not under the control of the druid. It might last but a single turn in the case of a tornado, or for hours or even days in other cases. The area of effect likewise varies from about 1 square mile to 100 or more square miles. Note that several druids can act in concert to greatly affect weather, controlling winds and/or working jointly to summon very extreme weather conditions. Within 4 turns after the spell is cast, the trend of the weather to come will be apparent, i.e., clearing skies, gusts of warm or hot air, a chill breeze, overcast skies, etc. Summoned weather will arrive 6 to 17 turns (d12 + 5) after the spell is cast.

    "description": "Explanation/Description: This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object. Enlargement causes increase in both size and weight. It can be cast upon only a single creature or object. Spell range is ½\" for each level of experience of the magic-user, and its duration is 1 turn per level of power experience of the spell caster . The effect of the enlargement spell is to increase the size of a living creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) by 20% per level of experience of the magic-user, with a maximum additional growth of 200%. The effect on objects is one-half that of creatures, i.e. 10% per level to a 100% maximum additional enlargement. The creature or object must be seen in order to effect the spell. The maximum volume of living material which can be initially affected is 10 cubic feet - for non-living matter, 5 cubic feet - per level of the magic-user. While magical properties are not increased by this spell - a huge +1 sword is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. - weight, mass and strength are. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective; a hurled stone would have more mass (and be more hurtful providing enlargement took place just prior to impact): chains would be more massive; doors thicker; a thin line turned to a sizable, longer rope; and so on. Likewise, a person 12\u0027 tall would be as an ogre, while an 18\u0027 tall person would actually be a giant for the duration of the spell. The reverse spell, Reduce, will negate the effects or actually make creatures or objects smaller in the tame ratios as the regular spell application functions. Unwilling victims of the spell. or its reverse, are entitled to a saving throw, which, if successful, indicates the magic does not function, and the spell is wasted. The material component of this spell is a pinch of powdered iron. ",

Note that any consequences of this use of the item fall fully upon the magic-user, although any saving throw normally allowed is still the privilege of the magic-user. For each segment the spell is in force, it is 15% + 5% per level of the magic-user probable that 1 property of the object touched can become known - possibly that the item has no properties and is merely a ruse (the presence of Nystul\u0027s Magic Aura or a Magic Mouth being detected). Each time a property can be known, the referee will secretly roll to see if the magic-user made his or her saving throw versus magic. If the save was successful, the property is known; if it is 1 point short, a false power will be revealed; and if it is lower than 1 under the required score no information will be gained. The item will never reveal its exact plusses to hit or its damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many such plusses can be discovered. If it has charges, the object will never reveal the exact number, but it will give information which is +/-25% of actual i.e. a wand with 40 charges could feel as if it had 30, or 50, or any number in between. The item to be identified must be examined by the magic-user within 1 hour per level of experience of the examiner after it has been discovered, or all readable impressions will have been blended into those of the characters who have possessed it since. After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the magic-user loses 8 points of constitution. He or she must rest for 6 turns per 1 point in order to regain them. If the 8 point loss drops the spell caster below a constitution of 3, he or she will fall unconscious, and consciousness will not be regained until full constitution is restored 24 hours later. The material components of this spell are a pearl (of at least 100g.p. value) and an owl feather steeped in wine, with the infusion drunk and a live miniature carp swallowed whole prior to spell casting. If a luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, probability increases 25% and all saving throws are made at +4.",

An example of the latter use is causing a creature attacking to lose its balance when it is attacking, for if the creature fails its saving throw, it will not be able to attack that round. Of course, the mass of the creature attacking cannot exceed the force of the Push by more than a factor of 50, i.e. a 1st level magic-user cannot effectively push a creature weighing more than 50 pounds. A Push spell employed against an object held by a creature will cause it to subtract the force of the spell in foot- pounds (1,2,3, etc.) from its chance to hit or add to opponent saving throws as applicable if the creature fails to make its saving throw against magic when the spell is cast. The material component of this spell is a small pinch of powdered brass which must be blown from the palm prior to pointing at the object of the spell. ",

Note that a huge amount of copper or brass can be turned to gold by the spell - assume 4,000 g.p. are equal to a cubic foot for purposes of this spell.

These masses must be anchored to two or more points - floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc. - diametrically opposed.The Web spell covers a maximum area of 8 cubic inches, and the webs must be at least 1\" thick, so a mass 4\" high, 2\" wide, and 1\" deep may be cast. Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck amongst the gluey fibres. Creatures with less than 13 strength must remain fast until freed by another or until the spell wears off. For every full turn entrapped by a Web, a creature has a 5% cumulative chance of suffocating to death. Creatures with strength between 13 and 17 can break through 1\u0027 of webs per turn. Creatures with 18 or greater strength break through 1\u0027 of webs per round. (N.B. Sufficient mass equates to great strength in this case, and great mass will hardly notice webs.) Strong and huge creatures will break through 1\u0027 of webs per segment. It is important to note that the strands of a Web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword will slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire - torch, flaming oil, flaming sword, etc. - will set them alight and burn them away in a single round. All creatures within the webs will take 2-8 hit points of damage from the flames, but those freed of the strands will not be harmed. Saving throw is made at -2. If the saving throw versus Web is made, two results may have occurred. If the creature has room to escape then he is assumed to have jumped free. If there is no room to escape then the webs are only ½ strength. The material component of this spell is a bit of spider web.",

(Cf. ADVANCED DUNGEONS \u0026 DRAGONS, MONSTER MANUAL, Blink Dog.) The segment of the round that the spell caster \"blinks out\" is determined by random roll with 2d4, and during this same segment he or she will appear again 2\u0027 distant from his or her previous position. (Direction is determined by roll of d8: 1 \u003d right ahead, 2 \u003d right, 3 \u003d right behind, 4 \u003d behind, 5 \u003d left behind, 6 \u003d left, 7 \u003d left ahead, 8 \u003d ahead.)

If that extra distance still dictates the magic-user and another solid object are to occupy the same space, the spell caster is then trapped on the ethereal plane. During and after the blink segment of a round, the spell caster can be attacked only by opponents able to strike both locations at once, e.g. a breath weapon, Fireball, and similar wide area attack forms. Those not so able can only strike the magic-user if they managed to attack prior to the \"blink\" segment. The spell caster is only 75% likely to be able to perform any acts other than physical attack with a hand-held stabbing or striking weapon during the course of this spell. That is, use of any spell, device, or item might not be accomplished or accomplished in an incorrect manner or in the wrong direction.

The range of the bolt is the location of the commencement of the stroke, i.e. if shot to 6\", the bolt would extend from this point to n inches further distance. The Lightning Bolt will set fire to combustibles, sunder wooden doors, splinter up to 1\u0027 thickness of stone, and melt metals with a low melting point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). Saving throws must be made for objects which withstand the full force of a stroke (cf. fireball). The area of the Lightning Bolt\u0027s effect is determined by the spell caster, just as its distance is. The stroke can be either a forking bolt 1\" wide and 4\" long. or a single bolt ½\" wide and 8\" long. If a 12th level magic-user cast the spell at its maximum range, 16\" in this case, the stroke would begin at 16\" and flash outward from there, as a forked bolt ending at 20\" or a single one ending at 24\". If the full length of the stroke is not possible due to the interposition of a non-conducting barrier (such as a stone wall), the Lightning Bolt will double and rebound towards its caster, its length being the normal total from beginning to end of stroke, damage caused to interposing barriers notwithstanding. Example: An 8\" stroke is begun at a range of 4\", but the possible space in the desired direction is only 3½\"; so the bolt begins at the 3½\" maximum, and it rebounds 8\" in the direction of its creator.

The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable; a request asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act will automatically negate the effect of the spell. However, a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure water, and a quick dip would be refreshing, is another matter; or the urging that a cessation of attack upon the magic-user\u0027s party would benefit a red dragon, for the group could loot a rich treasure elsewhere through co-operative action, is likewise a reasonable use of the spell\u0027s power. The course of action of a Suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above.

    "description": "Explanation/Description: The Polymorph Other spell is a powerful magic which completely alters the form and ability, and possibly the personality and mentality, of the recipient. Of course, creatures with a lower intelligence cannot be polymorphed into something with a higher intelligence, but the reverse is possible. The creature polymorphed must make a \"system shock\" (cf. CONSTITUTION) roll to see if it survives the change. If it is successful, it then acquires all of the form and abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into. There is a base 100% chance that this change will also change its personality and mentality into that of the creature whose form it now possesses. For each 1 point of intelligence of the creature polymorphed, subtract 5% from the base chance. Additionally, for every hit die of difference between the original form and the form it is changed into by the spell, the polymorphed creature must adjust the base chance percentage by +/-5% per hit die below or above its own number (or level in the case of characters). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form must be checked daily until the change takes place. (Note that all creatures generally prefer their own form and will not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell) If a one hit die orc of 8 intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 hit dice, for example, it is 85% (100% - [5% x 8 intelligence + [(6 - 1) x ( 5%] \u003d 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in any case it will have the dragon\u0027s physical and mental capabilities; and if it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it will know what it formerly knew as well. Another example: an 8th level fighter successfully polymorphed into a blue dragon would know combat with weapons and be able to employ them with prehensile dragon forepaws if the fighter did not take on dragon personality and mentality. However, the new form of the polymorphed creature may be stronger than it looks, i.e. a mummy changed to a puppy dog would be very tough, or a brontosaurus changed to an ant would be impossible to squash merely from being stepped on by a small creature or even a man-sized one. The magic-user must use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this too requires a \"system shock\" saving throw. The material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon. ",

The globe will move with the spell caster, Note that water breathing creatures will avoid a sphere (or hemisphere) of airy water, although intelligent ones can enter it if they are able to move by means other than swimming, but no water-breathers will be able to breathe in an area affected by this spell. There is only one word which needs to be spoken to actuate the magic, and the material component of the spell is a small handful of alkaline or bromine salts."

The magic-user is able to conjure an air, earth, fire or water elemental with this spell - assuming he or she has the material component for the particular elemental.

Conjured elementals are very strong - see ADVANCED DUNGEONS \u0026 DRAGONS, MONSTER MANUAL - typically having 16 hit dice (16d8). It is possible to conjure up successive elementals of different type if the spell caster has memorized two or more of these spells. The type of elemental to be conjured must be decided upon before memorizing the spell. The elemental conjured up must be controlled by the magic-user, i.e. the spell caster must concentrate on the elemental doing his or her commands, or it will turn on the magic-user and attack. The elemental, however, will not cease a combat to do so, but it will avoid creatures when seeking its conjurer. If the magic-user is wounded or grappled, his or her concentration is broken. There is always a 5% chance that the elemental will turn on its conjurer regardless of concentration, and this check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding round. The elemental can be controlled up to 3\" distant per level of the spell caster. The elemental remains until its form on this plane is destroyed due to damage or the spell\u0027s duration expires. Note that water elementals are destroyed if they move beyond 6\" of a body of water.

The type of elemental to be conjured must be decided upon before memorizing the spell. The elemental conjured up must be controlled by the magic-user, i.e. the spell caster must concentrate on the elemental doing his or her commands, or it will turn on the magic-user and attack. The elemental, however, will not cease a combat to do so, but it will avoid creatures when seeking its conjurer. If the magic-user is wounded or grappled, his or her concentration is broken. There is always a 5% chance that the elemental will turn on its conjurer regardless of concentration, and this check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding round. The elemental can be controlled up to 3\" distant per level of the spell caster. The elemental remains until its form on this plane is destroyed due to damage or the spell\u0027s duration expires. Note that water elementals are destroyed if they move beyond 6\" of a body of water. The material component of this spell (besides the quantity of the element at hand) is a small amount of:\nAir Elemental - burning incense\nEarth Elemental - soft clay\nFire Elemental - sulphur and phosphorus\nWater Elemental - water and sand\nN.B. Special protection from uncontrolled elementals is available by means of a pentacle, pentagram, thaumaturgic triangle, magic circle, or Protection From Evil spell."

If made principally of wood, it must be of ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be of platinum. If constructed of ivory. the metal fittings of the chest may be of gold; and if the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings may be of electrum or silver. The cost of such a chest will never be less than 5,000 g.p. Once constructed, the magic-user must have a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) made, so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. One magic-user can have but one pair of these chests at any given time, and even wish spells will not allow exceptions. While touching the chest and holding the tiny replica, the caster chants the spell. This will cause the large chest to vanish into the ethereal plane. The chest can contain one cubic foot of material per level of the magic-user no matter what its apparent size. Living matter makes it 75% likely that the spell will fail, so the chest is typically used for securing valuable spell books, magic items, gems, etc. As long as the spell caster has the small duplicate of the magic chest, he or she can recall the large one from the ethereal plane to the locale he or she is in when the chest is desired. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, including a wish, that the large chest will return. While on the ethereal plane, there is a 1% cumulative chance per week that some creature/being will find the chest. If this occurs there is 10% likelihood that the chest will be ignored, 10% possibility that something will be added to the contents, 30% possibility that the contents will be exchanged for something else, 30% chance that something will be stolen from it, and 20% probability that it will be emptied. In addition, when the secret chest is brought back to the Prime Material Plane, an ethereal window is opened and remains open for 5 hours, slowly diminishing in size. As this hole opens between the planes there is a 5% chance that some ethereal monster will be drawn through, with a 1% cumulative reduction in probability each hour thereafter until the window is gone. However, no creature on the Prime Material Plane can locate the chest even with a gem of seeing, true seeing, etc. If Leomund\u0027s Secret Chest is not retrieved before spell duration lapses, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest will be lost forever, i.e. 5% chance for loss at 61 days, 10% at 62 days, and so forth.",

    "description": "Explanation/Description: This is a spell which must be used by a magic-user planning to create a magic item. The Enchant An Item spell prepares the object to accept the magic to be placed upon or within it. The item to be magicked must meet the following tests: 1) it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2) the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e. crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; and 3) its cost or value must reflect the second test, and in most cases the item must have a raw materials cost in excess of 100 g.p. With respect to requirement 3), it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, and/or engraved; however, if such work or materials can be added to on item without weakening or harming its normal functions, these are required for the item to be magicked.The item to be prepared must be touched manually by the spell caster. This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 8-64 hours (as the magic-user may never work over 8 hours per day, and haste or any other spells will not alter time required in any way, this effectively means that Casting Time for this spell is 2 days + 1-8 days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1\u0027 distant from the spell caster, for if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic may be performed, and the magic-user must remain quiet and in isolation.) At the end of the spell, the caster will \"know\" that the item is ready for the final test. He or she will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the magic-user who magicked it) versus magic, the spell is completed. (Note that the spell caster\u0027s saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to but not exceeding +3.) A result of 1 on the die (d20) always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, the magic-user may begin to place the desired dweomer upon the item, and the spell he or she plans to place on or within the item must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must again be enchanted. Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 4 hours + 4-8 additional hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the magic-user, and during rest periods it must always be within 1\u0027 of his or her person. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive dweomer must be begun within 24 hours of the last, even if any prior spell failed. No magic placed on or into an item is permanent unless a Permanency spell is used as a finishing touch, and this always runs a risk of draining a point of constitution from the magic-user casting the spell. It is also necessary to point out that while it is possible to tell when the basic (Enchant An Item) spell succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually take, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally, items that are charged - rods, staves, wands, javelins of lightning, ring of wishes, etc. - can never be made permanent. Scrolls or magic devices can never be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared. The material component(s) for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being magicked and successive magicks to be cast upon it. For example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of 1 or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of a ki-rin.

    "description": "Explanation/Description: Otiluke\u0027s Freezing Sphere is a multi-purpose dweomer of considerable power. If the caster opts, he or she may create a globe of matter at absolute zero temperature which spreads upon contact with water or liquid which is principally composed of water, so as to freeze it to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet per level of the magic-user casting the spell. The ice so formed lasts for 1 round per level of the caster. The spell can also be used as a thin ray of cold which springs from the caster\u0027s hand to a distance of 1\" per level of the magic-user; this ray will inflict 4 hit points of damage per level of the caster upon the creature struck, with a saving throw versus magic applicable, and all damage negated if it is successful (as the ray is so narrow a save indicates it missed), but the path of the ray being plotted to its full distance, as anything else in its path must save (if applicable) or take appropriate damage. Finally, Otiluke\u0027s Freezing Sphere can be cast so as to create a small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, but not harmful. This globe can be cast, and it will shatter upon impact, inflicting 4-24 hit points of cold damage upon all creatures within a 10\u0027 radius (one-half damage if saving throw versus magic is made). Note that if the globe is not thrown or slung within a time period equal to 1 round times the level of the spell caster, it automatically shatters and causes cold damage as stated above. This timed effect can be employed against pursuers, although it can also prove hazardous to the spell caster and/or his or her associates as well. The material components of the spell depend upon in which form it is to be cast. A thin sheet of crystal about an inch square is needed for the first application of the spell, a white sapphire of not less than 1,000 g.p. value for the second application of the spell, and a 1,000 g.p. diamond is minimum for the third application of the spell.

If the caster opts, he or she may create a globe of matter at absolute zero temperature which spreads upon contact with water or liquid which is principally composed of water, so as to freeze it to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet per level of the magic-user casting the spell. The ice so formed lasts for 1 round per level of the caster. The spell can also be used as a thin ray of cold which springs from the caster\u0027s hand to a distance of 1\" per level of the magic-user; this ray will inflict 4 hit points of damage per level of the caster upon the creature struck, with a saving throw versus magic applicable, and all damage negated if it is successful (as the ray is so narrow a save indicates it missed), but the path of the ray being plotted to its full distance, as anything else in its path must save (if applicable) or take appropriate damage. Finally, Otiluke\u0027s Freezing Sphere can be cast so as to create a small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, but not harmful. This globe can be cast, and it will shatter upon impact, inflicting 4-24 hit points of cold damage upon all creatures within a 10\u0027 radius (one-half damage if saving throw versus magic is made). Note that if the globe is not thrown or slung within a time period equal to 1 round times the level of the spell caster, it automatically shatters and causes cold damage as stated above. This timed effect can be employed against pursuers, although it can also prove hazardous to the spell caster and/or his or her associates as well. The material components of the spell depend upon in which form it is to be cast. A thin sheet of crystal about an inch square is needed for the first application of the spell, a white sapphire of not less than 1,000 g.p. value for the second application of the spell, and a 1,000 g.p. diamond is minimum for the third application of the spell. All components are lost when the spell is cast."

Prior to actual utterance of a Spiritwrack spell the magic-user must prepare an illuminated sheet of vellum, carefully inscribed in special inks made from powdered rubies and the ichor of a slain demon of type I, II, or III and covered with gold leaf in a continuous border. The spell caster must personally prepare this document, including the being\u0027s name thereon. (This will require from 8-32 hours of time and cost 1,000 g.p. for vellum, special pens, gold leaf, and other miscellaneous materials alone; the cost of the powdered rubies is a minimum of 5,000 g.p. for each document.) If the demon, devil, or other powerful being from a nether outer plane is present in some form (and not possessing another creature\u0027s body instead), the magic-user can then begin actual spell incantation.Immediately upon beginning the reading of the document, the being named will be rooted to the spot unless it makes its magic resistance percentage (adjusted for the level of the magic-user) as a saving throw; and even if such a saving throw is made, the monster feels greatly uncomfortable, and if it has not been magically forced to the locale and so held there, it is 90% likely to retreat to its own (or another) plane, as the named being is powerless to attack the magic-user while he or she is reading the spell document. This first part of the document continues for 1 full round, with the discomfort to the named being becoming greater at the end. During the second minute of the incantation, the being named undergoes acute pain and loses 1 hit point per hit die it possesses. At the end of this round of reading, the being is in wracking pain. The third and final round of utterance of the condemnation will cause a loss to the being of 50% of its existing hit points, horrible pain, and at the end consign it to some confined space on its own plane - there to remain in torture for a number of years equal to the level of the magic-user who prepared the document.Obviously, the being so dealt with will be the sworn foe of the magic-user forever afterwards, so the magic-user will be loath to finish the spell but rather use it as a threat to force submission of the being. Each round of reading will cause the being forced to listen to be a cumulative 25% likely to concede even without any other offerings or payment.",

If the demon, devil, or other powerful being from a nether outer plane is present in some form (and not possessing another creature\u0027s body instead), the magic-user can then begin actual spell incantation.\nImmediately upon beginning the reading of the document, the being named will be rooted to the spot unless it makes its magic resistance percentage (adjusted for the level of the magic-user) as a saving throw; and even if such a saving throw is made, the monster feels greatly uncomfortable, and if it has not been magically forced to the locale and so held there, it is 90% likely to retreat to its own (or another) plane, as the named being is powerless to attack the magic-user while he or she is reading the spell document. This first part of the document continues for 1 full round, with the discomfort to the named being becoming greater at the end. During the second minute of the incantation, the being named undergoes acute pain and loses 1 hit point per hit die it possesses. At the end of this round of reading, the being is in wracking pain. The third and final round of utterance of the condemnation will cause a loss to the being of 50% of its existing hit points, horrible pain, and at the end consign it to some confined space on its own plane - there to remain in torture for a number of years equal to the level of the magic-user who prepared the document.\nObviously, the being so dealt with will be the sworn foe of the magic-user forever afterwards, so the magic-user will be loath to finish the spell but rather use it as a threat to force submission of the being. Each round of reading will cause the being forced to listen to be a cumulative 25% likely to concede even without any other offerings or payment."

    "description": "Explanation/Description: This perilous exercise in dweomercraeft summons up a powerful demon of type V, V, or VI, depending upon the demon\u0027s name being known to the magic-user. Note that this spell is not of sufficient power to bring a demon of greater power, and lesser sorts are not called as they have no known names. In any event, the spell caster must know the name of the type IV, V, or VI demon he or she is summoning. As the spell name implies, the demon so summoned is most angry and evilly disposed. The spell caster must be within a circle of protection (or a thaumaturgic triangle with Protection From Evil) and the demon confined within a pentagram (circled pentacle) if he or she is to avoid being slain or carried off by the summoned cacodemon. The summoned demon can be treated with as follows: 1) The magic-user can require the monster to perform a desired course of action by force of threat and pain of a Spiritwrack spell (q.v.), allowing freedom whenever the demon performs the full extent of the service, and forcing the demon to pledge word upon it. This is exceedingly dangerous, as a minor error in such a bargain will be seized upon by the monster to reverse the desired outcome or simply to kill and devour the summoner. Furthermore, the demon will bear great enmity for the magic-user forever after such forced obedience, so the spell caster had better be most powerful and capable. 2) By tribute of fresh human blood and the promise of 1 or more human sacrifices, the summoner can bargain with the demon for willing service. Again, the spell caster is well advised to have ample protection and power to defend himself or herself, as the demon might decide the offer is insufficient - or it is easier to enjoy the summoner\u0027s slow death - and decide not to accept the bargain as offered. Although the demon will have to abide by a pledge, as his name is known, he will have to hold only to the exact word of the arrangement, not to the spirit of the agreement. On the other hand, only highly evil magic-users are likely to attempt to strike such a bargain, and the summoned cacodemon might be favourably disposed towards such a character, especially if he or she is also chaotic. 3) The summoned demon can be the object of a Trap The Soul spell (q.v.). In this case, the magic-user will not speak with or bargain for the demon\u0027s services, although the cacodemon might be eager to reach an accord with the dweomercraefter before he is forced into imprisonment. The trapping of the demon is risky only if proper precautions have not been taken, for failure to confine the monster usually means only that it is able to escape to its own plane. Once trapped, the demon must remain imprisoned until the possessor of his object of confinement breaks it and frees him, and this requires one service from the now loosed monster. If the individual(s) freeing the demon fails to demand a service when the monster asks what is required of him, the demon is under no constraint not to slay the liberator(s) on the spot, but if a service is required, the creature must first do his best to perform it and then return to the Abyss. The duration of service of any demon must be limited unless the demon is willing to serve for an extended period. Any required course of action or service which effectively requires an inordinate period of time to perform, or is impossible to perform, is 50% likely to free the demon from his obligations and enable him to be unconstrained in his vengeance upon the spell caster if he or she is not thereafter continually protected, for a demon so freed can remain on the plane it was summoned to for as long as 666 days.The demon summoned will be exceptionally strong, i.e. 8 hit points per hit die.Casting time is 1 hour per type (numeric) of the demon to be summoned. If there is any interruption during this period, the spell fails. If there is an interruption while the cacodemon is summoned, it is 10% probable that it will be able to escape its boundaries and attack the magic-user, this percentage rising cumulatively each round of continued interruption.Each demon is entitled to a saving throw versus this summoning spell. If a score higher than the level of the magic-user summoning is rolled with 3d6 (2d6 with respect to type VI demons), that particular spell failed to bring the desired demon. When this occurs, it is certain that the named demon is imprisoned or destroyed or the name used was not perfectly correct, so the spell caster will have to call upon another name to bring forth a cacodemon.The components of this spell ore 5 flaming black candles; a brazier of hot coals upon which must be burned sulphur, bat hairs, lard, soot, mercuric-nitric acid crystals, mandrake root, alcohol, and a piece of parchment with the demon\u0027s name inscribed in runes inside a pentacle; and a dish of blood from some mammal (preferably a human, of course) placed inside the area where the cacodemon is to be held.",

When this occurs, it is certain that the named demon is imprisoned or destroyed or the name used was not perfectly correct, so the spell caster will have to call upon another name to bring forth a cacodemon.\nThe components of this spell ore 5 flaming black candles; a brazier of hot coals upon which must be burned sulphur, bat hairs, lard, soot, mercuric-nitric acid crystals, mandrake root, alcohol, and a piece of parchment with the demon\u0027s name inscribed in runes inside a pentacle; and a dish of blood from some mammal (preferably a human, of course) placed inside the area where the cacodemon is to be held."

The object must be singular, can be no larger than a sword is long, have no more mass and weight than a shield (about 75 g.p. weight), and it must be non-living. To prepare this spell, the magic-user must hold a gem of not less than 5,000 g.p. value in his or her hand and utter all but the final word of the conjuration. He or she then must have this same gem available to cast the spell. All that is then required is that the magic-user utter the final word while crushing the gem, and the desired item is transported instantly into the spell caster\u0027s right or left hand as he or she desires. The item must, of course, have been previously touched during the initial incantation and specifically named, and only that particular item will be summoned by the spell.

The use of a Limited Wish will not substantially change major realities, nor will it bring wealth or experience merely by asking. The spell can, for example, restore some hit points (or all hit points for a limited duration) lost by the magic-user. It can reduce opponent hit probabilities or damage, it can increase duration of some magical effect, it can cause a creature to be favourably disposed to the spell caster, and so on (cf. Wish). The Limited Wish can possibly give a minor clue to some treasure or magic item. Greedy desires will usually end in disaster for the wisher. Casting time is the actual number of seconds - at six per segment - to phrase the Limited Wish."

The subject of the spell must be seen by the caster, and the magic-user must know the subject\u0027s true name as well when the final word is uttered. Preparatory to the actual casting of the Trap The Soul the magic-user must prepare the soul prison, a gem of 1,000 g.p. value for every hit die or level of experience the creature whose soul is to be trapped possesses, i.e. it requires a gem of 10,000 g.p. value to trap a 10 hit dice (or 10th level) creature by placing an Enchant An Item spell upon it and then placing a Maze spell into the gem, thereby forming the prison for the soul to be trapped. There are 2 manners in which the soul of the victim can be imprisoned. The final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range, but this entitles it to exercise its magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw versus magic as well, and if the latter is successful, the gem shatters. The second method of soul trapping is far more insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word which will automatically place the creature\u0027s soul into the trap. If this method is used, it will be necessary to name the triggering item when the prison gem is magicked. A Sympathy spell may be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its soul is automatically transferred to the gem. The gem prison will hold the soul trapped until time indefinite, or until it is broken and the soul is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the creature trapped is a powerful creature from another plane (and this could actually mean a character trapped by some inhabitant of another plane of existence when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go totally free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.",

    "description": "Explanation/Description: The Wish spell is a more potent version of a Limited Wish (q.v.). If it is used to alter reality with respect to hit points sustained by a party, to bring a dead character to life, or to escape from a difficult situation by lifting the spell caster (and his or her party) from one place to another, it will not cause the magic-user any disability. Other forms of wishes, however, will cause the spell caster to be weak (-3 on strength) and require 2 to 8 days of bed rest due to the stresses the wish places upon time, space, and his or her body.

If it is used to alter reality with respect to hit points sustained by a party, to bring a dead character to life, or to escape from a difficult situation by lifting the spell caster (and his or her party) from one place to another, it will not cause the magic-user any disability. Other forms of wishes, however, will cause the spell caster to be weak (-3 on strength) and require 2 to 8 days of bed rest due to the stresses the wish places upon time, space, and his or her body.

The total hit dice of the shadow monster or monsters thus created cannot exceed the level of experience of the Illusionist; thus a 10th level Illusionist can create one creature which has 10 hit dice (in normal circumstances), two which have 5 hit dice (normally), etc. All shadow monsters created by one spell must be of the same sort, i.e. hobgoblins, orcs, spectres, etc. They have 20% of the hit points they would normally have. To determine this, roll the appropriate hit dice and multiply by .20, any score less than .4 is dropped - in the case of monsters with one (or fewer) hit dice, this indicates the monster was not successfully created - and scores of .4 or greater are rounded up to one hit point. If the creature or creatures viewing the shadow monsters fail their saving throw and believe the illusion, the shadow monsters perform as normal with respect to armour class and attack forms. If the viewer or viewers make their saving throws, the shadow monsters are armour class 10 and do only 20% of normal melee damage (biting, clawing, weapon, etc.), dropping fractional damage less than .4 as done with hit points.
